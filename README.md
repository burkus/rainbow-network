## Recently Updated! :D (7/16/2017)
### New Stuff:
1. Hot Module Reloading and dev server now setup.
2. Updated to webpack 2.0+
3. Completely redone project layout that's easier to use.
4. Added a linter so the error messages actually make sense.
5. Created a "cheap event system" that reduces project complexity.


## Scripts
1. npm install | setup project dependencies

2. npm build | compile and lint
